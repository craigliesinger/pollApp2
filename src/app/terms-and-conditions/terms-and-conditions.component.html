We don't care to own nor use any of the data you enter on our site - we just want to help you run live surveys.  As for personal data, we collect the bare minimum (email or google account), and we will never sell your information to anyone else, ever.  Our payment services are all using 3rd party provider Stripe, one of the top trusted names in internet payments.  Now, below, all the legal mumbo jumbo the lawyers say we need...</h4>
